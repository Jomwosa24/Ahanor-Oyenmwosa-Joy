    <h1>An Organ like no other</h1>
    <p>The brain is a round corrugated flesh that has a consistency somewhere between jelly and cold butter.It is such a strange organ that if you sliced the top of a person's head you won't see anything happening inside.</p>
    <p>Over the past millennials the brain had been regarded as a useless organ. Aristotle thought the brain was a radiator for cooling blood. Ancient Egyptians when mummifying their dead scooped out the brain and threw it away but carefully preserved the heart. The brain is very indispensable for life. There are several functions of the brain and it includes the following;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regulation of blood pressure, heart beat, sex drive and sleep cycle.</li>
        <li>Generates the emotions, perception and thoughts that guide our behaviours.</li>
        <li>It is responsible for the conscious awareness of self.</li>
        <li>It directs and executes our actions.</li>
    </ul>
